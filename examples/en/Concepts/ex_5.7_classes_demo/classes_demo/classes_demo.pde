*  _5.7_classes_demo
* 
* In this example, you will be introduced to how classes and objects work in actual code. 
* Note that the example has two tabs for the animal classes and one tab where we create our 
* objects and call the classesâ€™ corresponding functions. 
* The tab where the action happens is what we will here on refer to as the main program.
